Open "toggleShortcut.ahk" with notepad or somewhat editing soft and replace,in the two lines that begin with "Run", the path by YOUR path to the file, file name and extension included
e.g."pathToTheFolder/ActualHideDesktopIcons.exe"
in my case "D:\Cet ordinateur magnifique\Documents\AutoHotKey\toggleShortcut\ActualHideDesktopIcons.exe"

I did not make the exe file, just the autohotkey script
I downloaded the exe file from https://superuser.com/questions/238089/is-there-hotkey-for-show-desktop-icons-function-in-windows
